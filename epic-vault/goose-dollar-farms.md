# Epic Dollar Farms

Epic Dollar farm is very similar to the vault but instead of staking single tokens or LP tokens, you stake the Epic Dollar rewarded from using the vault. When 1 Epic Dollar is staked into the farms, Epic Dollar Vault will stake $1 BUSD into the farm. The profits from using Epic Dollar will be different from the vaults, as this is free money given by the vault and our vault bears the risk of losing money.

\***If the profit is negative, the user will not be able to unstake the rewards**
