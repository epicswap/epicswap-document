**Epic Dollar is 1:1 Backed by BUSD \(NOT PEGGED\).** The initial 2,000,000 BUSD was funded by Epic Finance's team. The amount of Epic Dollar will always be the same as the amount of BUSD backed.

**Transaction:** [**https://bscscan.com/tx/0x057af0eb70bea8594c774549003740d807fff7bf9448a5458d5a3ed7b1d5e67a**](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x057af0eb70bea8594c774549003740d807fff7bf9448a5458d5a3ed7b1d5e67a)**â€‹**

The minting speed of Epic Dollar will depend on the remaining BUSD in the Epic Dollar Vault that hasn't been tagged with the Epic Dollar. Therefore, if there are more BUSD in the Epic Dollar Vault, the minting speed will increase.

At this stage, we are not providing liquidity for users to sell this Epic Dollar, as we want users to re-invest this into the system to grow the vault.

A portion of the profit generated from Epic Dollar will be shared among the holder of another token, **Epic Dollar Bond.**
