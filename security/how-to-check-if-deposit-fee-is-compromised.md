# How to check if deposit fee is compromised

**PREVIOUSLY STAKED FUNDS are not affected**

Our system requires users to deposit a fee when staking, therefore it is possible for the chef to edit the deposit fee to 100%, therefore taking 100% of NEW USER STAKING.

Procedure to check:

1\) Please head to our master chef contract site on BSC

​[https://bscscan.com/address/\#readContract](https://bscscan.com/address/#readContract)​

2\) scroll down to 9. poolInfo

3\) query \(type in the number 0 - 22\)

4\) click onto the lpToken to see which currency/farm you are looking at

5\) check if the depositFEEBP is correct \(400 = 4%, 10000 = 100%\)
