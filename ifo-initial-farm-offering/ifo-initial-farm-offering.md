# IFO \(Initial Farm Offering\)

## Intro <a id="intro"></a>

Buy new tokens using Epic-BUSD LP tokens.

The project gets the BUSD, Epic Finance burns the Epic. **You get the tokens.**

1. **You will need Epic-BUSD LP tokens** to participate.
2. **Epic tokens equating to half of the total funds raised will be burned forever**: For example the full $1,000,000 USD allocation is raised, then $500,000 of Epic tokens will be burned.
3. All IFO involves risk. We did our due diligence but we cannot be 100% sure the team behind isn't malicious. Please do your own research and do not invest anything more than you are willing to lose

## **How to participate in an IFO** <a id="how-to-participate-in-an-ifo"></a>

Before Sale:

1. ​[Buy Epic](https://exchange.epicswap.io/#/swap) and BUSD tokens
2. ​[Get Epic-BUSD LP tokens](https://exchange.epicswap.io/#/pool) by adding EGG and BUSD liquidity

During Sale:

1. While the sale is live, commit your EPIC-BUSD LP tokens to buy the IFO tokens at [https://www.epicswap.](https://www.epicswap.io/)io​

After Sale:

1. When the sale is complete, claim the IFO tokens you've bought. Your unspent funds will also be sent back to you.
2. Done! In the case of an overflow you can unstake your remaining EPIC-BUSD LP tokens.

If you decide to acquire Epics-BUSD LP tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them in the [EPIC-BUSD Farm](https://www.epicswap.io/code) to earn Epic token rewards while waiting for the sale.

While you are holding Epic-BUSD LP tokens you will be at risk of [Impermanent Loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained).

## **What is the “Overflow” sale method?** <a id="overflow"></a>

TLDR: Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

In the “Overflow” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

It's possible to receive no tokens at all: If you commit a very small amount of LP tokens compared to the total amount committed by others, your contribution may be such a small part of the total that you may not qualify for even a small portion of the tokens sold. In such a case, you will still be able to reclaim all the EGG-BUSD LP tokens you committed.

## What happens if the IFO doesn't raise all the funds targeted? <a id="what-happens-if-the-ifo-doesnt-raise-all-the-funds-targeted"></a>

The sale will proceed as normal, and all funds contributed will be spent.

## How about the liquidity? <a id="how-about-the-liquidity"></a>

20% of the raised fund will be used to provide liquidity and locked for 1 month after the IFO. The amount will be ejected back to the other party by interacting with our contract.[
