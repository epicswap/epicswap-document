# Introduction

## Epic Vault

Epic Vault is a yield optimizer platform focused on providing DeFi users with auto-compounded yields at empirical optimal intervals. Epic Vault uses a proprietary dynamic harvesting optimizer to enable the highest APYs on our vaults.

## Epic Dollar

What makes Epic Vault different from other platforms is that we do not print a new token that fluctuates in price but instead we reward users a **1:1 BUSD backed Epic Dollar** to users to re-invest.

## Epic Dollar Bond

Users can also buy Epic Dollar Bond which is 1 BUSD, which is used to mint more Epic Dollar and share the profit generated from the Epic Dollar and the main vault.
