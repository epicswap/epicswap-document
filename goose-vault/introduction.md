# Introduction

## Goose Vault

Goose Vault is a yield optimizer platform focused on providing DeFi users with auto-compounded yields at empirical optimal intervals. Goose Vault uses a proprietary dynamic harvesting optimizer to enable the highest APYs on our vaults.

## Goose Dollar

What makes Goose Vault different from other platforms is that we do not print a new token that fluctuates in price but instead we reward users a **1:1 BUSD backed Goose Dollar** to users to re-invest.

## Goose Dollar Bond

Users can also buy Goose Dollar Bond which is 1 BUSD, which is used to mint more Goose Dollar and share the profit generated from the Goose Dollar and the main vault.
