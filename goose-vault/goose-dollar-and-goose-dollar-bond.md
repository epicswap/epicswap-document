The minting speed of Goose Dollar will depend on the remaining BUSD in the Goose Dollar Vault that hasn't been tagged with the Goose Dollar. Therefore, if there are more BUSD in the Goose Dollar Vault, the minting speed will increase.

At this stage, we are not providing liquidity for users to sell this Goose Dollar, as we want users to re-invest this into the system to grow the vault.

A portion of the profit generated from Goose Dollar will be shared among the holder of another token, **Goose Dollar Bond.**
