# Introduction



Layered farming is a perpetual farming tool to allow EPIC users to constantly enjoy a high-risk high-reward APY yield farming. Imagine a new xxxxswap site but hosted on Epic Finance where you can ape your money into it with no rugpull, no dumping, no hidden pool! The value of EPIC will disappear throughout the course of its life, it is not meant to be held for a long term.

A new token, Epic, EPIC \(x represents the layer number\), will be created every 7 days.   
**ex. Layer 1 = EPIC 1, Layer 5 = EPIC 5**

This mechanism is also trying to reduce the supply and create deflationary pressure on our major token $EPIC.

**Tokenomics:**

* **Each layer will be supplied with a liquidity of 100,000 USD in BUSD and BNB each \(total 200,000\), with 20,000 EPIC**
* The starting price of EPIC will be **$10**
* **Maximum Supply: 1,000,000 EPIC per layer \(Roughly 30 days\)**
* **All layers will never close until further notice \(just so people don't need to scroll through 50 layers\). Farms will stop minting EPIC when the maximum supply has reached.**
* 1 EPIC produce every block
* 28800 EPIC per day
* 9.09% will be sent to the developerâ€™s address and burnt/do nothing \(as we may require to provide additional liquidity or any action required with the token itself\)

**The Layered Farming consist of 3 parts**

1\) Incubator - Staking Epics or EPIC\(X-1\) to get EPIC \(also burning the eggs in the deposit fee\)

2\) Epic Farm - Staking EPIC-BUSD / EPIC-BNB / Tokens to get EPIC

3\) Epic House - Staking EPIC to get BUSD



**Deposit Fee**

* The Deposit fee from Goose farm will be used as follow:
  * \(1.4%\) 70% will be swapped to BUSD and injected into Goose House.
  * \(0.4%\) 20% will automatically buyback Eggs and burnt
  * \(0.2%\) 10% will be sent to the developer address 

**Burn Fee**

* Burn Fee \(Eggs\) from incubator will be directly burnt
