# Goose Dollar Farms

Goose Dollar farm is very similar to the vault but instead of staking single tokens or LP tokens, you stake the Goose Dollar rewarded from using the vault. When 1 Goose Dollar is staked into the farms, Goose Dollar Vault will stake $1 BUSD into the farm. The profits from using Goose Dollar will be different from the vaults, as this is free money given by the vault and our vault bears the risk of losing money.

\***If the profit is negative, the user will not be able to unstake the rewards**
