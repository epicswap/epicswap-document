# Vaults

Users stake their corresponding Single token or LP token in our vault, and Epic Vault will auto-compound the corresponding farm so the user doesn't need to manually compound the rewards every day.

## **General Vault fees \(subjected to changes\)**

* 1.2% Buyback on Epic \(on profits\)
* 0.3% Epic Dollar Bond's Epic house reward \(on profits\)
* 0.5% Epic's Epic house reward \(on profits\)
* 0.5% EUSD Vault \(on profits\) 
* 0.5% Controller Operations \(on profits\)
* 0.1% Entrance fee

## Rewards

Apart from the rewards of the auto-compounding itself, we will also reward the user a Epic Dollar, **which is 1:1 Backed by BUSD**, instead of a platform token that constantly inflates in price.
